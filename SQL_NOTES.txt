4 types of joint:
1)Inner join-A intersection B(common from A and B)
2)left join- Left Table + Inner join
3)Right join-Right Table + Inner join
4)Full join-Left Table + Right Table + Inner join

Sub-Query-Query inside another query(Subquery is a query whose result are used by another query)
Q.Find average salary filter employees where salaru is greater than avg salary'
select employees,salary from table where salary>(select avg(salary) from table 

Transaction: A Transaction is a sequence of sql operations executed as a single unit where either all changes are commited or all rolled back(ALL ARE NOTHING)

Start transaction
	SQL Statement 1
	SQL Statement 2
	SQL Statement 3
	SQL Statement 4
COMMIT (Save changes)
OR ROLLBACK

Indexting:it helps sql find data faster,just like a book index or page number
without index:
	start from page 1
	read every page
	very slow
with index:
	go to index
	directly jump there

Drawbacks of indexing:
	Don't use when the table is small
	It occupies some space
	Insert,Update,Delete becomes slow after indexing

SQL COMMANDS:
	1)DDL(Data Definition Language) -- STRUCTURE (DESIGN)
	2)DML(Data Manipulation Language) -- DATA (ROWS)
	3)DQL(Da -- FETCH DATA
	4)DCL -- SECURITY
	6)TCL -- TRANSACTIONS

1)DDL(Data Definition Language) Commands:
		1)CREATE
		2)ALTER
		3)DROP
		4)RENAME
		5)TRUNCATE

2)DML(Data Manipulation Language) commands:
		1)INSERT
		2)UPDATE
		3)DELETE

3)DQL(Data Query Language) commands:
		1)SELECT

4)DCL(Data Control Language) commands:
		1)GRANT syntax-> GRANT SELECT IN customers To user1;
		2)REVOKE syntax-> REVOKE SELECT IN customers to user1;
5)TCK(Transaction Control Language) commands:
		1)COMMIT
		2)ROLLBACK
		3)SAVEPOINT
		
#Q.1FIND TOTAL HOURS WORKED BY EACH EMPLOYEE
SELECT e.emp_id, e.emp_name, SUM(ep.hours_worked) AS total_hours FROM employees e JOIN employee_projects ep ON e.emp_id = ep.emp_id
GROUP BY e.emp_id, e.emp_name;

#Q.2FIND TOTAL HOURS SPENT ON EACH PROJECT
SELECT p.project_id, p.project_name, SUM(ep.hours_worked) AS total_hours FROM projects p JOIN employee_projects ep ON p.project_id = ep.project_id GROUP BY p.project_id, p.project_name;

#Q.3FIND DEPARTMENT WISE TOTAL WORKING HOUR
SELECT e.department, SUM(ep.hours_worked) AS total_hours FROM employees e JOIN employee_projects ep ON e.emp_id = ep.emp_id GROUP BY e.department;


NORMALISATION : Converting a messy data into a good data(BAD TABLE-------->>GOOD TABLE)
	WHY NORMALISATION:
		1)Data manipulation
		2)Insert anomaly
		3)Update anomaly
		4)Delete anomaly

A)1NF:Each column should contain atomic(single) values
	I)One Shell-->one value       +------------+--------+---------+
       II)Atmoic values	          | student_id | name   | subject |
				      			  +------------+--------+---------+
		                          |          1 | amit   | math    |
				                  |          1 | amit   | sql     |
	                              |          2 | pankaj | java    |
				                  +------------+--------+---------+

B)2NF:Table must follow 1NF and no partial dependencies


SQL LITE:
	Inbuilt in python
	--small
	--within a file

SQLITE is a lightweight database that stores data in a single file and is inbuilt into python
	COMMANDS:
		connect()-->connect database
		cursor()-->run SQL
		execute()-->execute SQL
		commit()-->save changes
		close()-->close connection

use execute.script to write all commands at once
